Hi, I'm Cameron — a software engineer with a background in automation and robotics systems, primarily in the material handling industry.
I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in 2025, and before that a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Kennesaw State University in 2017.
Personally I find nearly anything that requires electricity fascinating, and professionally I’m passionate about building tools that make difficult things simple - whether that’s automating manual tasks, functional 3D printing, designing scalable services in the cloud, or integrating hardware and software in the real world, I'm in my happy place when I'm building something.

I work primarily with Linux, Python, and modern web technologies, but I’m always exploring new areas — including but by no means limited to topics like embedded systems, cybersecurity, wireless networking, computer vision, machine learning, and many more.
My projects often focus on making technical concepts more accessible, solving real-world problems with practical solutions, and occasionally just tinkering for the sake of learning something new.

This blog is a place where I share what I’m working on, document things I’ve learned (usually the hard way), and hopefully make life a little easier for others who find themselves asking the same questions I do.

Thanks for stopping by.
